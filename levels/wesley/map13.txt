Release Revision 2.2   Feb 6, 2011

CHANGES Rev 2.2
  Fixed things per FreeDoom forum review.
  Added some trees.
  Added crate to step-up on dumpster.
  Adjusted pump-room service way.
  Added shelf and niche in utility room.
  Moved set of switches in control room.
  Added crate in secure dock.
  Added door in secure service way.
  Kinked sewer to hide view of dead-end.
  Added platform and stored stuff in furnace room.
  Adjusted weapons.
  Moved deathmatch starts.
  Added multiplayer weapons and ammo.

CHANGES Rev 2.01:
  Fixed a small HOM at the spillway on the big nukage pool.
  Fixed a sight line by raising the height of the building at the exit.
  Now the chimney stack is not cut-off looking over that building.

HAS BEEN DONE:
  Play tested at 1,2,3,4.
  Finished at level 4.
  Play tested on Legacy, prboom.
  Not all combinations tested.

Level is large,
  1035 sectors, 6000+ sidedefs.
  If it has to get smaller then I would have to cut
  the elevator, or the curved stairs.

  There are still some places where the corner of a
  building gets clipped, but they have been reduced to
  the point where it is not worth it any more. 


Play:
  Non-linear, freestyle.
  Can attack in at least 3 different ways, by different routes,
  by running wild, sneaking around, or careful planning.
  Many monsters roam free and will be encountered unexpectedly.
  Watch your back. I have got shot in the back so
  many times I am getting paranoid.
