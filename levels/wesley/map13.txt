Release Revision 1.1.   Sept, 9, 2009

Change:
  Fixed Boom Deep-water colormap usage


HAS BEEN DONE:
  Play tested at 1,2,3,4.
  Finished at level 4.
  Play tested on Legacy, prboom.
  Not all combinations.

Level is large,
  1030 sectors, 6000+ sidedefs.
  I have spent a week cutting anything I could.
  If it has to get smaller then I would have to cut
  the elevator, or the curved stairs.

  There are still some places where the corner of a
  building gets clipped, but they have been reduced to
  the point where it is not worth it any more. 


Play:
  Non-linear, freestyle.
  Can attack in at least 3 different ways,
  by different routes,
  by running wild, sneaking around, or carefully planed.
  Watch your back. I have got shot in the back so
  many times I am getting paranoid.
