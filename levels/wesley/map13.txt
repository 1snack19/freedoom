Release Revision 2   Feb 17, 2010

Change:
  Adjusted some window and door textures.
  Changed lock coding of some doors (blue key only, not blue skull).
  Moved some ammo and weapons.
  Finished interior of final room.
  Added an area in pump room so more difficult to get to ammo room.
  Increased difficulty of Hard level by adding a few more monsters in
  early play.

HAS BEEN DONE:
  Play tested at 1,2,3,4.
  Finished at level 4.
  Play tested on Legacy, prboom.
  Not all combinations tested.

Level is large,
  1031 sectors, 6000+ sidedefs.
  If it has to get smaller then I would have to cut
  the elevator, or the curved stairs.

  There are still some places where the corner of a
  building gets clipped, but they have been reduced to
  the point where it is not worth it any more. 


Play:
  Non-linear, freestyle.
  Can attack in at least 3 different ways, by different routes,
  by running wild, sneaking around, or careful planning.
  Many monsters roam free and will be encountered unexpectedly.
  Watch your back. I have got shot in the back so
  many times I am getting paranoid.
