Release Revision 8.   Mar 6, 2013

CHANGES Rev8, by Wesley Johnson:
Fixed secret floor on lower level so trigger and floor move together.
Added switch behind secret floor to raise secret wall.
Added block behind secret wall to aid in escape, in case get in past wall
without lowering floor.
Raised top level of middle tower, and added steps.  Crenelated the
outer wall of this tower.
Resized secret door to riverside tower passage, and changed to
a paneled texture.  Added a bookcase to match.
Removed floating covers over outdoor teleports because of the drawing errors
when viewing taller towers over them.

CHANGES Rev6, by Wesley Johnson:
Fixed doors to operate using the Boom skull keys.
Many switches were missing tag numbers.  Had to implement something.
Some switch operations would not work and had to devise something else.
Made all switches operate something.
Made all areas reachable.
Gave the castle a proper entrance, which was complicated to implement, as it
required two silent teleports to pass the player under the occupied
wall and tower defenses.  However, it came out rather nice.
It required an annoying door that appears to snap open when player
teleports, but have to hide the missing passageway from view.  Requires more work.
Provided a road to give rationale to the extra wall and tower, as such
were built to control road and river trade routes.
Provided underground secret passage where existing passage was
passing through a collapsed part of wall.  Gave the secret a keyed
door because play testing showed it was too easy to go to first thing.
Gave the area a river to keep player away from sky texture,  and a hill to hide
bottom of sky texture (which was showing).  Not totally fixed in non-play areas.
Fixed texture alignments throughout castle area.
Moved some special items around for playability.
This is enough to make it playable in the FreeDoom release without
appearing half-done.



Features:
  Castle theme.
  Multiple layers implemented using silent teleport.
