This contains the latest.wad, which is all of the new stuff since the 
last proper release. To use, download the last real release from
the sourceforge download page, then do something like:

	(doom port of your choice) -file freedoom.wad latest.wad

or to play with the iwad, assuming the freedoom iwad is called doom2.wad:

	(doom port of your choice) -iwad doom2.wad -file latest.wad

This will allow you to play freedoom including all of the recent
stuff from latest.wad.
