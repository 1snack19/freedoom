= Freedoom

Freedoom is a project to create a complete Doom II-compatible IWAD file
which is Free Software.

The IWAD file is the file used by Doom which contains all the game data
(graphics, sound effects, music, etc.). While the Doom source code is
Free, you currently still need one of the proprietary IWAD files from id
in order to play Doom. Freedoom aims to create a Free alternative.
Combined with the GPL-licensed Doom source code this will result in a
complete Free Doom-based game.

For more information, see http://www.nongnu.org/freedoom/.

== What "Free Software" means

When we speak of Free Software, we refer to the software movement in
which your freedoms to use, copy, modify, and study it are ensured.  For
example, you may freely use Freedoom for any purpose you see fit, you
may redistribute it to anyone without needing to ask for permission, you
may modify it (provided you keep the license intact, see `COPYING`), and
you may study it -- for example, to see how a Doom IWAD is built.  To
facilitate this, you can get the full source code (here, in the form of
a DeuTex tree) for Freedoom.

You may read more about Free Software at the http://www.gnu.org/[GNU]
and http://www.fsf.org/[Free Software Foundation] websites.

== Contributing to Freedoom

Contributions to Freedoom are always welcome, however there are a few
guidelines that should be followed:

=== Levels

Levels should be in Boom format; you may exceed the limits of Vanilla
Doom and use Boom features; however, do not use features that are not
supported by Boom 2.02 and compatible ports. Levels should be in Doom's
original format, not in "Hexen" format.

It is sensible to also heed the following guidelines:

  * Make sure that skill levels are implemented, and that all
    multiplayer start points are present.
  * Make levels appropriately difficult for their position within the
    progression of the game.  Also bear in mind that not all players may
    be as skilled a player as you.
  * Do not use tricks that exploit Doom's software renderer; some source
    ports, especially those that use hardware accelerated rendering, may
    not render it properly.  Examples of tricks to avoid include those used
    to simulate 3D bridges and "deep water" effects.
  * Boom removes almost all of the limits on rendering; however, do not
    make excessively complicated scenes.  It is desirable that Freedoom
    levels should be playable on old or low-powered hardware.
  * Always test in http://www.teamtnt.com/boompubl/boom2.htm[Boom]
    itself rather than a derivative such as PrBoom.  This ensures that
    your levels really are Boom-compatible rather than using any extra
    features.  As DOS is rather rare these days, if you do not have a
    system which runs Boom natively, you may use
    http://www.dosbox.com/[DOSBox] or http://www.freedos.org/[FreeDOS].

=== Resources (music, sprites, textures, etc)

TODO: Write this section too

=== Build process

The Freedoom build process is fairly complete and should not change
without good reason.  Write a decent explanation why your method is
better; just enough to get your point across is good enough.

=== Documentation

Freedoom always needs help with the documentation, so please send your
patches, but keep in mind:

  * We use http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] for writing the
    documentation.  AsciiDoc is a simple plaintext-based format which is
    simple to read and write in its source form, and makes pretty HTML
    documents out of them (it also supports other formats like
    DocBook/PDF/manual pages...).
  * Headers are formated in a wiki-style format, this makes it easier
    for Vim (perhaps other editors, too) to automatically re-format
    text.
  * Text is kept at 72 characters wide.  In Vim, you can set the editor
    to automatically insert line breaks as you're typing by performing
    `set textwidth=72`.  Special exceptions to the width rule might be
    allowed when necessary (for example, inserting long URLs).

=== Submitting your work

TODO: Figure out the best method of doing this.  Also expand this
section.

If you use git, make sure your commit messages start with a single line,
under 72 characters, which provides an adequate summary of your changes.
You should prefix this line with the component you are committing (for
example, ``map17: fixed unbeatable map'').  This should be followed by a
blank line and a paragraph or more to explain your change in detail (for
example, explaining what part of the map was broken).  See commit
27762aa5f34f590bfc29d1f667f9121907cb8a98 for an example.  If you use
GPG, try to sign your commits with `git commit -s` if possible; this
ensures that you are who you say you are.

You should commit often; each important change should get its own
commit, but minor changes need not.  Take advantage of git's ability to
rewrite history, don't use `git revert` on your private copy of the
repository, just remove (`git reset`) or amend (`git commit --amend`)
the faulty commit as necessary.  Leave all the interesting and important
history bits, leave out stupid mistakes like spell check errors.
