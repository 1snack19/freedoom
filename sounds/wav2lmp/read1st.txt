delete the other uploaded .zip, it has a slight error

for fraggle.

i was bored so i wrote this, i find being a GNU-GPL whore strangely fufilling. :)

this converts all .wavs in current directory to .lmps in the doom sound format.

just in case you can't find a switch to not squish 22050 -> 11025 in deutex, compile this,
place this in the appropriate directory, run it, and change the deutex config to insert all
sounds as lumps instead.

i tested it on the current sounds directory, seems to work fine, the sounds sound
fine in doom and everything.

read the comments at the top of the .c file, they're more descriptive than this text file is.

:)

oblivion
